    "-------------------------------------------\n",
    "In the following code, we will extract two sources of data (US Mass Shootings from 1982-2022 and Firearm Provisions in US States per year from 1991-2017). \n",
    "We will then clean and transform the data to be able to merge the files on state and year. \n",
    "We will generate two dataframes listing each state, year, number of gun regulations present in that state at that year, and number of mass shootings that took place in that state and year. One table will be an inner join and one table will be an outer join.\n",
    "An additional column called \"state cumulative shootings\" is added to show the cumulative number of mass shootings in a state over the years.\n",
    "Finally, we will create a connection to SQL to load the dataframe into a data table to be displayed and turned over for data analysis."
